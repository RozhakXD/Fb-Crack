### Getting Successful Results

- Using good user-agents such as : **REALME, OPPO, POCO, XIAOMI, SAMSUNG, INFINIX, ONEPLUS, PIXEL, NEXUS, HUAWEI.**
- Search for the target account in the Threads app search recommendations.
- Use good methods like : **Instagram Apps or Threads Apps.**
- I hope you use a single user-agent so you can see which is a good user-agent.
- Noted for now only new accounts and small follower accounts are successful.

### No Results?

- The target you entered is not good or the password they used is a combination of special characters.
- You don't play **"Airplane Mode"** it is recommended to turn on at 200 username.
- Wrong password selection. Use the recommended password is **DEFAULT, COMPLETE** or number **01, 02**.

### Open Checkpoint Results?

- Only works on accounts that are online and the owner has confirmed **"Yes it's me"!**
- First wait about 1-7 days or 30 days after cracking.
- Run the script then select number One or **"Crack Hasil Checkpoint".**
- Enter the name of the file you want to crack **"dir Results"** to find out the file name.

### Why Can't Use WIFI?

- WiFi causes your IP address to be blocked or spam.
- Not getting a Success or Checkpoint result.
- WiFi causes it to get stuck at the words **"HIDUPKAN MODE PESAWAT 2 DETIK".**

### I Only Got Checkpoints?

- Instagram's security is getting tighter and they update all the time.
- Wrong selection of user-agent and method.
- Your provider may have a problem.
- The target that you entered is not good or has been cracked by someone.

### Account Always Logged Out?

- Accounts must include information such as name, biography and profile photo.
- Change the password on your Instagram account.
- Use a fresh cracked account from Instagram.
- Post a few photos every day so you don't think it's a fake account.
- Before logging in to Termux the account was logged in to the Threads application and was online.
