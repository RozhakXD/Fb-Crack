## Troubleshooting
When working with a brute force tool for Threads accounts, you may encounter several common issues that can impact your success. Identifying and addressing these problems strategically is essential to maximize your results and ensure effective operation of the tool.

### Enhancing Success Rates
- **User-Agent Selection**: Use high-quality user-agents such as `REALME`, `OPPO`, `POCO`, `XIAOMI`, `SAMSUNG`, `INFINIX`, `ONEPLUS`, `PIXEL`, `NEXUS`, `HUAWEI`. These user-agents mimic real devices, reducing detection risks and improving success rates.
- **Method Usage**: Choose reliable methods like `Instagram Apps` or `Threads Apps`. These methods have been tested and are more likely to yield successful results.
- **Target Search**: Look for target accounts in the search recommendations within the Threads app. This increases the likelihood of finding active and accessible accounts.
- **User-Agent Consistency**: Stick to a single user-agent throughout your attempts. This allows you to track which user-agent works best for your target.
- **Account Type**: Focus on new accounts or those with fewer followers. These accounts typically have weaker security measures, making them easier to target.

### Resolving Issues with No Results
- **Incorrect Password Selection**: Using the wrong password approach can lead to no results. Stick with recommended passwords such as `DEFAULT`, `COMPLETE`, or options like `01` and `02` for better chances.
- **Unfavorable Target**: The account you’re targeting may be too secure, or the password could be complex with special characters. Try selecting different targets or focus on those with simpler credentials.
- **Airplane Mode Misuse**: Failing to activate Airplane Mode after every 200 attempts can reduce your success rate. It's recommended to enable Airplane Mode to refresh your network connection.
- **Device Variability**: We observe that results can vary across different devices. Not all devices yield satisfactory results, so success may depend on the specific device you are using.

### How to Access Checkpoint Results
- **Confirm Account Status**: Ensure that the account you are targeting is online and that the owner has confirmed with **Yes, it's me!** This confirmation is essential for proceeding.
- **Wait Period**: After the initial cracking attempt, wait for about **1-7 days**, or up to 30 days, before attempting to access the checkpoint results. This waiting period helps ensure a higher chance of success.
- **Run the Script**: Execute the script and choose option one, labeled `Crack Hasil Checkpoint` This will initiate the process to open the checkpoint results.
- **File Name Entry**: Input the exact name of the file you want to crack from the "Results" directory. Make sure you know the precise file name to proceed effectively.

### Challenges with Using WiFi
- **Process Stalling**: WiFi can cause the process to get stuck, especially when you encounter messages like "HIDUPKAN MODE PESAWAT 2 DETIK". This issue occurs because WiFi connections can be unstable and affect the script’s performance.
- **IP Blocking**: WiFi connections often result in your IP address being blocked or flagged as spam by Instagram. This can hinder your ability to get successful results.
- **Unsuccessful Results**: If you're not achieving successful or checkpoint results, it might be due to the limitations of WiFi connections.

### Why Am I Only Getting Checkpoints
- **Target Quality**: The target account you’re trying to crack might be of low quality or could have already been attempted by others, reducing your chances of success.
- **Instagram Security Updates**: Instagram frequently updates its security measures, making it more challenging to bypass and increasing the likelihood of getting checkpoints.
- **Incorrect User-Agent or Method**: Choosing the wrong user-agent or method can lead to unsuccessful attempts and result in checkpoints instead of successful logins.
- **Provider Issues**: Your network provider might have restrictions or issues that affect your ability to bypass security and get successful results.

### Understanding Dump Failures
- **Target Verification**: Ensure that the target account is not locked and does not have a blue verification checkmark.
- **Account Blocked or Checkpoint**: Your account might be blocked for 24 hours or experiencing a checkpoint. This can prevent successful dumping.
- **Account Logout**: Your Threads account may have been logged out. Check and ensure that your account is still logged in.
- **Target or Cookie Issues**: Errors during the dump are often due to problems with the target or cookies. Consider updating or replacing them.
- **Account Status**: Make sure your Threads account is online and refresh it every few minutes to prevent logout and maintain session stability.

### [Resolving Login Issues](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10kp-862cR3HOuvWRqGx--ZM-Wg-0IG4d/view?usp=drive_link)
- **Update Your App**: Ensure you are using the latest version of Instagram or a trusted Threads clone app for compatibility.
- **Use Cracked Cookies**: Login using the cookies that were obtained through the cracking process.
- **Enable Airplane Mode**: Activate "Airplane Mode" on your device before attempting to log in to prevent detection.
- **Avoid Browser Login**: Do not log in through a browser if the account was accessed using the `Application` method.
- **Blocked Device or IP**: If you are unable to log in at all, it is likely that your device or IP address has been blocked. This issue is likely on the Threads side.

Addressing these problems requires patience and strategic adjustments. By identifying issues and applying the right solutions, you can improve your chances of success in brute-forcing Threads accounts.
